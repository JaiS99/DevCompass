Welcome to DevCompass (CodeExplorers)!

## Introduction

DevCompass, also known as CodeExplorers, is an open-source project aimed at helping beginners with little to no prior programming knowledge to explore the world of coding and gain a sense of what they can achieve through programming. The platform provides curated roadmaps for various domains within the field of programming, guiding newcomers on their learning journey and outlining the essential skills they need to acquire.

## Project Goals

The main objectives of DevCompass (CodeExplorers) are as follows:

1. **Empower Beginners**: Create a welcoming environment for beginners in programming, regardless of their age, background, or prior knowledge. Encourage and motivate them to explore the vast possibilities that programming offers.

2. **Learning Roadmaps**: Offer well-structured and curated roadmaps for different domains in programming, including but not limited to web development, data science, mobile app development, and more.

3. **Skills Assessment**: Provide an easy-to-understand assessment of the skills required for each domain, enabling learners to gauge their progress and focus on areas that need improvement.

4. **Community Engagement**: Foster a supportive and inclusive community of learners where they can interact, ask questions, seek guidance, and share their experiences.
